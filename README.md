# Object Oriented Programming in Python: #
* Python doesn't require us to use Objects & Classes , if we want to create individual functions , data structures etc then we are free to do it.<br />
* Complex programs are hard to keep organised.<br />
* Object-oriented Programming Structures & Organises Code.<br />
* It groups together data & behaviour into one place.<br />
* Promotes modularization of programs.<br />
* Isolates different parts of the program from eachother.<br />
